Magma Carta Personal Explosives™

lol!


if we compact the stunts for gear, i think it's easy to see where the cost diff is, but it we spell it otu 

alternately, we could got for a baseline with expansion options style. 

# Gear [1¤]

words.

{aspect}, {aspect}

**Stunt 1**​—Description

**Stunt 2 [+1¤}**​—Description


Part of the issue is that this description issue is an issue with generic items. 
if it's a very specific named item, then this is less of an issue. and in such cases the above base, plus options might be clearer
